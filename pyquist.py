This module contains functions for calculating the canidate intrinsic 
frequencies and amplitudes that may underlie an observed sub-Nyquist signal,
or the sub-Nyquist frequencies and amplitudes that would be measured from
some intrinsic super-Nyquist signal.

This code was developed for the analysis of pulsating white dwarfs observed
at long-cadence by the Kepler K2 mission. If this code is helpful to you,
consider citing our original work:

That paper includes a thorough discussion of important considerations for 
dealing with super-Nyquist signals.
